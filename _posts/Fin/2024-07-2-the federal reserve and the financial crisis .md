Note of the federal reserve and the financial crisis
# The Roles and Responsibilities of Federal

The main Role of federal play is try to achieve macroeconomic stability, avoiding big swings(keep financial stability), and keeping inflation low and stable and stable growth

How to achive this target mention above?

- Purchases and sales of securities in market in normal times
- Try to create more stable macroeconomic envrironment 
- Monetary policy: For example Fed can raise or lower short-term interest rates
- make short-term loans to financial institutions: Casue financial institution has long-term illiquid assets, that is not easy to sell(what is liquid assets? deposites!!! you could get cash anytime you want), if people start panic, they want get deposites as soon as possible from insititution, but insititution hold large illiquid assets, and  less cash flow, if the Fed does not lend money to institutions (which use illquid assets as collateral), then the institutions will sell their assets at low prices to pay depositors in cash, causing market panic and affecting other institutions.

Why US central bank(fed) created on December 23, 1913? The problem was disagreement between what today we would call Main Street and Wall Street. The folks on Main Street—farmers, for example—feared that the central bank would be mainly an instrument of the moneyed interests in New York and Philadelphia and would not represent the entire country, would not be a national central bank. Both the first and the second attempts at 
creating a central bank failed for that reason. 
>- Main Street: Main Street symbolizes the average American citizens and small businesses. It’s a term used to describe the broader economy and day-to-day lives of ordinary people.
>- Wall Street: Wall Street is a metonym for the financial markets, major banks, investment firms, and financial institutions. It refers to the high-stakes world of finance and investment.

So now, in US Federal Reserve distribute 12 federal bank in while US


For monerary policy in many decade ago, Dollar Pegged to Gold AKA Gold Standard， it from 19th to 1971, the vantage and disvantage list below, 

**advantage**
- Currency Stability:Gold, as a rare and inherently valuable metal, provided a relatively stable basis for currency. Pegging the dollar to gold helped to reduce inflation and maintain long-term purchasing power.
- Limitation on Government Currency Issuance:Linking currency to gold restricted the government's ability to print money excessively, helping to prevent inflation and currency devaluation.

**disadvantage**
- Limited Economic Flexibility:Because the dollar was pegged to gold, the US government and the Federal Reserve were limited in their ability to respond to economic crises, recessions, and inflation, as they could not flexibly adjust monetary policy.

Unflexibly is the most disadvantage of gold standard, when economic grow fast, gold stadard will make country deflation(Limited Money Supply Expansion when economic grow fast),if you are farmer deflation, that means that the price of 
your corn or cotton or grain is falling over time, but your payment to the bank stays the same

The Great Depression of 1929 is closely related to the gold standard. Here’s how the gold standard contributed to the severity and spread of the Great Depression:
- Limited Money Supply: Under the gold standard, the money supply of a country is directly tied to its gold reserves. This means that the money supply cannot be adjusted flexibly according to economic needs. During an economic downturn, reduced demand and falling prices led to deflation. The rigid constraints of the gold standard made it difficult for governments and central banks to increase the money supply to stimulate the economy.
- High Interest Rates and Credit Contraction: Due to the limited money supply, it was difficult to lower interest rates effectively, leading to high borrowing costs. Businesses and individuals found it challenging to obtain loans for investment and consumption, exacerbating the depth of the economic downturn.
- Global Transmission Effects: At that time, most developed countries were on the gold standard. Economic problems in the United States quickly spread to other countries through the international gold standard system. To maintain fixed gold exchange rates, countries were forced to adopt contractionary monetary policies, leading to a global economic downturn.
- Lack of Flexibility: The gold standard restricted the flexibility of governments and central banks to respond to economic crises. To maintain the gold standard, countries had to adopt contractionary fiscal and monetary policies, which were often counterproductive during a recession.

The other factor of causing Great Depressed is mentioned below

- Liquidationist theory: Liquidationist theory belive liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate which all inefficient will make economy healthy

- stop stock market speculation && maintain the gold standard: Then the gov will **not** to ease monetary policy, if you have gold standrad, you got fixed rate, and other country have gold standard too, they will transmitted same problem soon

The above mentioned effect extreme deflation

During the Great Depression US gov tried many way to get out of the quagmire, like force  pirce keep in high level(cause deflation each firm need survive so they turn price low) and so on... but most of important policy is abandoning gold standard in 1933, so fed can make monetary policy beccame much less tight and then there was much powerful rebound in the economy in 1933 and 1934

Other pulicy also play the key role in rebound the economy, like depoist insurence(FDIC) in 1934, once bank failed, depositor still can get money back, this pulicy make thousands of bank failures annually to ZREO.

# The federal reserve after warⅡ
Once again The main Role of federal play is try to achieve macroeconomic stability, avoiding big swings(keep financial stability), and keeping inflation low and stable and stable growth

wars are financed very substantially by borrowing. During World War II, the U.S. national debt increased quite substantially to pay for the war and Fed in cooperation with the Treasury, used its ability to manage interest rates to keep interest rates low, after War the debt is still here, so the fed keep the interest low after war, the low interest will make economy growthing and recovering, but on other hand low interest will rise **inflation**

The most important thing for fed is **US Treasury agree to let the Fed set interest rates independently in 1951**, central bank that is independent can ignore short-term political pressures, for example, to pump up the economy before an election, and in doing so, it can take a much longer perspective and get better results

Actually the 1950s and 1960s the monetary policy was too easy easy monetary policy led to a surge in inflation and high employment rate, By the end of the 1970s, the consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate peaked at about 13 percent. Inflation was a growing problem starting in the mid-1960s and into the 1970s

I want to mention not only easy monetary policy will make inflation, but also external factor like OPEC used its cartel power to embargo oil exports. Over a short period in the early 1970s(actually in 1970 it's Stagflation which mean High Unemployment and High Inflation), the price of oil almost quadrupled, causing a very sharp increase in gas prices

In October 1979,  previous fed Chairman Paul Volcker and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), allowed the Fed to raise interest rates quite sharply. Raising interest rates slows the economy and brings inflation pressures down, **And it worked**, from 1980 to 1983, inflation fell from about 12 or 13 percent all the way down to about 3 percent, you could find in **CPI** index, one of high interest rate in 1981 to 1982 you could think if you wanna buy a house that rate with 30 year mortgage 18.5 percent, of course with high interest the unemployment rate was pretty high in 1982 almost 11 present, this is a lot of political pressure is also an example of why independence is important, so how US breakaway in 1979?
- Use tight monetary policies, rise interet rate to curb inflation
- implemented various economic reforms, including tax cuts, deregulation, and promoting free-market competition. These policies helped improve economic efficiency and foster growth. 
- global oil prices fell significantly, alleviating the cost-push inflation pressures caused by the oil crises of the 1970s.

In 1987 to 2006 that the period has come to be known as the **Great Moderation**, as opposed to the Great Stagflation of the 1970s or the Great Depression of the 1930s
> The Great Moderation refers to the period of reduced volatility in economic output and other macroeconomic indicators

why Great Moderation is **better** than great stagflation and  great depression? If you have a company and too much inventory means you have a lot of inventory, then you won't be able to produce anything for quite a while until the inventory is exhausted, so a **sustained low inflation is the best state**.

You must hear or experience the recent crisis 2008 depression, One of the key events that led ultimately to the recent crisis was a big increase in house prices a big part of what was happening to create the housing bubble or the increase in housing prices was psychology(or sociology in China), why housing price increase sharply?
- Great Moderation make economic prosperity a long time(from 80s to 2006), after this period time **people have great confidence** to  think housing was a “can’t lose” investment, so a lot of people borrowed more than they could afford
- Early 2000s the down payment of home buyer is 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent, and have document their finances (their income, their assets, and so on), by 2007, 60 percent of nonprime loans had little or no documentation of the creditworthiness of the borrower. So there was clearly an ongoing deterioration of mortgage quality 


And now you could look housing price of us(2014), you could say "Oh my gosh, we have a long way to go”, 2014 housing price is still higher than 2003, of cause lower than 2008, there is no adjustment for inflation. So even if there was just 2 percent inflation per year, over a period of fifteen years that would raise prices by 30 or 40 percent. So if you adjust for inflation, you find that house prices now are coming much closer to where they were before the beginning of the bubble.  

After 2008 the housing price collapse quickly, there are some key consequence

- money they owed on their mortgages was greater than the value of 
their homes
- people not paying on time, and ultimately the bank taking over the property then reselling the property to somebody else,in 2009there were more than five million mortgages in delinquency, which is almost 10 percent of all mortgages

> 2001 dot-com bust led only to a mild recession cause
>- Fed responded quickly to the economic slowdown by aggressively cutting interest rates
>- The broader economy was relatively strong despite the collapse in the tech sector. Other sectors, such as housing and consumer spending, remained robust. 
>- The labor market was relatively flexible, allowing displaced workers from the tech sector to find employment in other industries more easily.


the decline of house prices had a much bigger impact on the financial system and the economy than the decline of stock  prices did. The decline in house prices and the mortgage losses were a trigger, **there were weaknesses in the financial system that transformed what might otherwise have  been a modest recession into a much more severe crisis.**

What were those financial system vulnerabilities in 2008 
-   In the private sector:
    1. many borrowers and lenders took on too much debt, too much leverage. And one reason they did that may have been the Great Moderation. With twenty years of relatively calm economic and financial conditions, people became more confident, willing to take on more debt. The problem with taking on too much debt is that if you do not have much margin, if the value of your asset goes down, then pretty soon you will find that you have an asset that is worth less than the amount of money you borrowed.

    2. financial firms in a variety of contexts relied very heavily on short-term funding such as commercial paper, which can have a duration as short as one day and most of it is less than ninety days. So, like the banks in the nineteenth century that were relying on deposits and making loans, on the liability side of their balance sheets, they had a very short-term, liquid form of liability, which was subject to runs in the same way that deposits were subject to runs in the nineteenth century 
    >This passage points out that financial companies highly rely on short-term financing tools in their funding structures. This reliance means that these companies need to frequently refinance to maintain their cash flow. If market conditions suddenly deteriorate or financing channels abruptly dry up, financial companies may face severe liquidity issues, as they would be unable to obtain the necessary funds in time, potentially leading to financial distress or crisis. This practice of relying on short-term financing can be effective in stable market conditions but significantly increases risk during economic or financial market volatility. Therefore, a company should not overly depend on highly liquid assets, nor should it overly depend on low liquid assets. 

-  In the public sector: 
    1. during this period, financial transactions were becoming more and more complex but the ability of banks and other financial institutions to monitor and measure and manage those risks was not keeping up, An example of this was the credit default swaps (CDSs) employed by the AIG Financial Products Corporation As long as the economy and the financial system were doing well,But once things went bad, their being on one side of all these bets meant that they were exposed to enormous losses, which had, as we will see, very serious consequences. 
    > The supervisor lack oversight

    2. A final, and perhaps more subtle, point is that the way our regulatory system is set up, individual agencies, such as the Fed or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Office of Thrift Supervision, typically had as their responsibility just a specific set of firms. So the Office of Thrift Supervision was responsible only for thrifts and similar institutions. Unfortunately, the problems that arose during the crisis were much broader based than that. They transcended any single firm or small group of firms; they encompassed the whole system.


In the final, housing price booms and busts are **not** very  closely to monetary policy etc. the European Central Bank, and the same monetary policy. Germany’s house prices remained absolutely flat throughout the entire crisis, whereas Spain had an enormous house price increase, it's more like psychology and sociology in  housing price up down


# The Federal Reserve’s Response to the Financial Crisis
Once againm, the two main responsibilites of central banks
- finanical stability
- economic stability

i will list some term, which use frequencely, in below sentence to describe 2008 depression
- GESs(government-sponsored enterprises): government-sponsored enterprises just like Fannie and Freddie, which are the middleman between the originator of the mortgage(Like financial insitution who Package mortgage loans into financial derivatives to sell to investor ) and the ultimate holder of the mortgage,  Fannie and Freddie take all the mortgages they purchase and put them together into mortgage-backed securities to sell to investors  and **provide** guarantees against credit loss(This important)

- MBSs( mortgage-backed securities): take all the mortgages they purchase and put them together into mortgage-backed securities to sell to investors

- ARM(adjustable rate mortgage): it's for bad credit persion, initial interest rate was 1 percent, which meant that you could afford the payment for the first year or two. Now, after two years, the mortgage interest rate might go up to 3 percent, then after four years, 5 percent, and then higher 
and higher
 

the factor which cause 2008 depression is multiple, the high housing price and falling down is the result, the ovsersigh and bad mortgage and some financial derivatives(which relate bad mortage) is the root

Some examples of bad mortgage practices include
- interest-only (IO) adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs);
- option ARMs (which permit borrowers to vary the size of 
monthly payments);
- long amortizations (payment periods greater than thirty 
years);
- negative amortization ARMs (initial payments do not even 
cover interest costs);
- no-documentation loans.


and most dangerous is this bad mortage  producted into financial derivatives and purchased by many many investor(including other financial institute), once thing go bad, the system will collapse(it's did happen), but the credit rating agencies give triple A to thoes financial firm, cause this financial firm good at negotiate with credit rating agencies, once thing go bad, the GESs like Fannie and Freddie to provide insurance to investor.


crisis of 2008–2009 was a classic financial panic, As house prices fell in 2006 and 2007, people who had subprime mortgages were not able to make the payments. It was increasingly evident that more  and more were going to be delinquent or default, If you put together all the subprime mortgages in the United States and assumed they were all worthless, the total losses to the financial system would be about equivalent to one bad day in the stock market The problem was that they were distributed throughout different securities and different places and nobody really knew where they were and who was going to bear the losses

Bear Stearns, a broker-dealer, came under intense pressure in the  short-term funding markets in March 2008 and was sold to JPMorgan Chase with Fed assistance on March 16. Things calmed down a bit after that, and over the summer there was some hope that the  financial crisis would moderate. But then in the late summer, things really began to pick up.

On September 7, 2008, Fannie and Freddie clearly were insolvent. They did not have enough capital to pay the losses on their mortgage guarantees. The Federal Reserve worked with Fannie and Freddie’s regulator and with the Treasury to determine the size of the shortfall, and over that weekend, the Treasury with the Fed’s assistance placed those firms into a form of limited bankruptcy called a conservatorship. At the same time, the Treasury got authorization from Congress to guarantee all of Fannie and Freddie’s obligations. So, the firms were in a partial bankruptcy but the U.S. government now guaranteed their mortgage-backed securities. So that protected those investors

Lehman Brothers have a lot of MBSs in 2008 the private MBSs flood the market, the private MBSs is not guarantee by Freddie’s regulator, and It came under great pressure and could not find  anybody either to buy it or to provide it with capital, and so on September 15th, it filed for bankruptcy

Normally thes big, high-profile international meeting is boring, because much of this work is done in advance by the staff, but 2008 G7 is not, the bank and other fiancial institution had access to funding from central banks and capital from government, one of biggest evident to prove the cooperation are success: the overnight rate is get low before the cooperation
> overnight rate:e banks need  some place to park their money overnight and they have a lot of confidence that it is safe to lend to another large bank overnigh, in 2007 the overnight rate is high lot of bank is loss confidence In March 2008, you can see another little peak around the time Bear Stearns was forced to sell itself after the international announcements. ithin a few days we began to see a reduction in funding pressure 

in crisis for make more liquidity, the fed adjust the discount window
> tranditionly the discount window is fed base collateral to borrow money to bank, this is short-term or overnight, No extraordinary step, and now this discount window not only for bank but finacial insitute, and make them long term, and  auctions of discount window funds, in which firms bid on how much interest they would pay. 

**providing liquidity to firms that are suffering from loss of funding is the best way to calm a panic**

MMF(money market fund): basically investment funds in which you can buy shares, and the funds take your money and invest it in short-term liquid assets(which is more safely and very low interest like **commercial paper**). Money market funds historically almost always maintain a one-dollar share price. So they are very much like a bank, and they are often used by institutional investors such as pension funds(serve for rich person)
> the pension funds would not put that into a bank because that much money is not insured; there is a limit to how much deposit insurance covers.

from corporations side, this company(manufacturing) need issue commercial paper to get cash to manage their daily operations, Financial corporations including banks, would also issue commercial paper to get funds that they could then use to manage their liquidity positions and to make loans to the private economy

why we need known lit about MMF?, MMF is play a key role in 2008 crisis. MMF hold a lot commerical paper, since lehman failed casued the money market funds to experience run, then sharp increase rate of commercial paper(in common rate of commercial paper is low, commercial paper key role is for overnight), so around 2008 the MMF market is nearly shut

in 2008 crisis, two big financial insititute met crisis, one is lehman and other is AIG, once again the function of two compay list below
- AIG: AIG is world major insurance company, the offer the the insurance to MBSs commercial paper , bond, loan and other financial derivatives which default
- lehman: Lehman Brothers purchased large amounts of mortgages, bundled them into MBS, and then sold these securities to investors. 


as the result fed save AIG, not lehman, because if AIG went bankrupt the damage of range is widely, because AIG is world largest insurence company, AIG make money in each field, if they failed, people will not believe all financial derivatives, and the lehman just buy the mortgages made to MBSs then sell to investor if lehman failed the damage is lesser then AIG , this is why fed save AIG.

if once big company get failed and fed save they life will cause "too big too fail",big companies an incentive to take excessive risks, where they will say: “Well, we’ll take big risks. Heads I win, tails you lose. If the risks pay off, we make plenty of money. And if they don’t pay off, the government will save us.”


# The aftermath of the crisis


**providing liquidity to firms that are suffering from loss of funding is the best way to calm a panic** is essential trick to against crisis whatever in 1929 or 2008
