# Preface
Parameter:A parameter is a fixed value or characteristic used to describe a population, like population mean population standard deviation

Statistical: by contrast Statistical is an adjective used to describe sample, like sample mean sample sd

Standard Deviation(Population):$\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{i=n}(x_i - \mu)^2}{N}}$

>$\mu$ is population mean, $N$ is population size

Standard Deviation(Sample):$\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x}^2)}{n-1}}$
> $n$ is sample size, $\bar{x}$ is sample mean 

Standard Error:$\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
> $\sigma$ is sample standard deviation, $n$ is sample size

>SE is the **standard deviation** of its sampling distribution, in other word SE is for multi sample

Z-Score(**one** sample): $\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$
>x is obvious value, $\mu$ is sample mean, $\sigma$ is sample standard deviation

Z-Score(**multi** sample): $\frac{x-\mu}{SR}$
>x is obvious value, $\mu$ is sample mean, SR is sample of standard error
